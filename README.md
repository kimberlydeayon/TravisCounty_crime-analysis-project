# Crime Hotspot Analysis in Austin, Texas

## Overview
This project investigates crime hotspots in Austin using tract-level crime and census data. 
We explore socioeconomic predictors of crime, test statistical and machine learning models, 
and apply spatial analysis methods to understand clustering and local variation.

## Contents
- **presentation/**  
  Final PowerPoint slides summarizing findings and implications.
- **documents/**  
  Written report with detailed methodology and results.
- **data/**  
  CSV files containing aggregated crime and census data at the tract-year level.
- **notebooks/**  
  Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) with code for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Methods
- **EDA:** Crime rate per 1,000 residents, hotspot identification.
- **Modeling:** Linear regression, logistic regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.
- **Spatial Analysis:** Moran’s I, LISA, Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR).
- **Findings:** Hotspots linked to socioeconomic traits (renter %, poverty %, education, home value), not race.

## Implications
Results suggest that community support policies—housing stability, poverty reduction, and education access—are more effective than stricter enforcement in addressing crime hotspots.
